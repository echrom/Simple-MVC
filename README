XtendMVC formerly known as (Simple MVC) is a simple, clean and minimal MVC framework in PHP.
It was created for educational purposes and small personal web projects.

It allows layout templates and will look through a hierarchy of layout names in order:

- controller-action.php
- controller.php
- application.php

It will always use application.php if no other files are created and throw an error if it is not available.

A appController.php file needs to be created in '/app/controllers/' which gets instantiated with each route.

We are currently working on getting the framework ready for cross platform and working on the website http://xtendmvc.com/ where people can submit there Xtentions (Helpers) where it will allow the user to just drag and drop the file into the helpers folder.
